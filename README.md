<h1> 👩‍💻 How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes 🧠🌱 </h1>
<br> Hellooo Everyone! It's me Khushi a Curious Kid!
Welcome to my little corner of the JavaScript and me series💗

Here you'll find my handwritten notes 📝 on how JavaScript works behind the scenes — from the moment you run your code to how JS engines magically make everything work.
This is me trying to understand what happens under the hood... and trust me, it's pretty cool! 😄
